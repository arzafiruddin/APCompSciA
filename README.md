# APCompSciA

## Description
This repository simply contains all the programs I created during my AP Computer Science A course in Spring 2019, which essentially covered object-oriented programming techniques in Java along with:
- Primitive and Object Types
- Conditional Statements
- Classes
- 1D Arrays, Array Lists, and 2D Arrays
- Recursion
- Inheritance

> NOTE: All the programs and scripts in this repository were simply used to learn Java and the associated programming concepts
